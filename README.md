# Uno Core Platform

Welcome to Uno.

We're here to help [Fuse] development by building and maintaining several related pieces of core technology.
* Cross-platform tools for building and running applications
* Core libraries and platform abstraction
* Uno programming language and compiler
* Uno project format, build engine and package manager
* UX markup language and compiler
* Uno/UX test runner

Uno is used on macOS and Windows, and makes native apps for the following platforms:
* Android
* iOS
* macOS (native or Mono)
* Windows (native or .NET)

**Uno syntax**
```uno
class App : Uno.Application
{
    public App()
    {
        debug_log "Hello, world!";
    }
}
```

The Uno programming language is a fast, native dialect of [C#] that can cross-compile to *any native platform* (in theory),
by emitting portable [C++11] for mobile or desktop platforms, or [CIL bytecode] for desktop platforms (Mono/.NET) —
designed for developing high-performance UI-engines, platform abstractions or integrations, and other kinds of
software traditionally required written in native C/C++.

Access all APIs and features on the target platforms directly in Uno — add a snippet of *foreign code*, and
our compiler automatically generates the glue necessary to interoperate (two-way) with a foreign language.
The following foreign languages are supported:
* [C++11], [C99]
* [Java] (Android)
* [Objective-C] (iOS, macOS)
* [Swift] (iOS)

**Run-time features**
* Memory in Uno is managed *semi-automatically* by [automatic reference counting], avoiding unpredictable GC stalls.
* *Real* [generics] – sharing the same compiled code in all generic type instantiations, without [boxing] values, and with
  *full run-time type system* support – avoiding exploding code-size and compile-times (while still being fast).
* *(Opt-in)* [reflection] on *all* platforms – to dynamically create objects and invoke methods based on type information
  *only known at run-time* – enabling high-level Fuse features such as *live-previewing UX documents*.

## Building

Uno is built using the command-line on macOS or Windows. Linux is not yet supported.

### Prerequisites

- [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/) / [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)<sup>[1](#win-prereq-1)</sup>
- [Bash](http://www.msys2.org/) and [Make](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)<sup>[2](#win-prereq-2)</sup>
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/downloads/)

| Build command                       | Action                                                                  |
|:------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make`<sup>[3](#win-prereq-3)</sup> | Builds `uno` and standard library. Works on all platforms.              |

<a name="win-prereq-1">1</a>: We need `vswhere` to locate your Visual Studio 2017 installation. Please make sure we can find `vswhere` in *PATH*
or at `%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer`. [This program](https://github.com/Microsoft/vswhere)
is included with the installer as of Visual Studio 2017 Update 2 and later.

<a name="win-prereq-2">2</a>: Our cross-platform build scripts are written in `bash`, and `make` is a convenient way to invoke the different build tasks.

<a name="win-prereq-3">3</a>: You also can run `bash scripts/build.sh` directly if you don't have `make`.

### Additional make targets

| Build command   | Action                                                                  |
|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make install`  | Creates symlinks for `uno` (alias `uno-dev`) in `/usr/local/bin`.       |
| `make release`  | Creates a packaged release build for distribution.                      |
| `make unocore`  | Generates C# code for Uno.Runtime.Core.dll, based on Uno code.          |
| `make clean`    | Removes build artifacts from the repository and `Packages.SourcePaths`. |
| `make check`    | Runs the local test suite.                                              |

## Running

To run `uno` in your terminal, type `<current-directory>/bin/uno`.

Add `<current-directory>/bin` to your *PATH* to get `uno` (alias `uno-dev`) globally available in your environment.

You can also type `make install` if you want symlinks in `/usr/local/bin`.

On Windows, some additional runtimes might be needed.

* [VCRedist 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784)

## Debugging

When Uno is built, a C# solution is generated in `<current-directory>`.
To debug, open `uno.sln` in a capable
IDE<sup>[1]</sup> and go from there. Use `main/Uno.CLI.Main` as startup
project to launch `uno`'s main method.

<sup>[1]</sup> Such as Visual Studio 2015+ or JetBrains Rider.
